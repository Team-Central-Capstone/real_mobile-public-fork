# REAL: Real People, Real Connections
## Matching People on Dating Apps by Geolocation Proximity and Temporal Parameters

There are numerous dating apps on the market between the two major app stores: Google Play and Apple App Store. Each of these applications have slightly modified ways of bringing people together, however the main thread is still the same: first impressions based on appearance. There has to be ways to create deeper, real connections between people.

For our Capstone project, we wanted to research and develop methods for matching people together based on a combination of GPS coordinate proximity and time that they were near each other. In order to facilitate this research, we decided to build a mobile dating app that would track the users’ location all day so the application could see when people were near each other. Building off of other research, we were able to design an algorithm that measures peoples’ compatibility and then match them together based on variable physical proximity and variable time frames.
